Lore:
I made this script to automatically notify my fiance that I have arrived/left the office by having it ping my phone if I am in the office premises or not.

Added good boy points:
-Have your phone a fixed IP DHCP or static in your network so you don't have to change the script everytime your phone has a new IP.

Lots of possibilities for this script
